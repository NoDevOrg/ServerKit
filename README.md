# Why should I use this package

You don't need to use this package. You can use [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) or [GRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift) directly. You should use this package if you don't want to write the same boilerplate or piping connecting the different libraries together everytime. The same reason why you might use [SpringBoot](https://spring.io) on Java or [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in Javascript - it just makes getting started a lot easier.
